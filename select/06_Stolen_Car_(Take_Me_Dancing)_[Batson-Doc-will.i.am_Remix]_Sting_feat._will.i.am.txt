Please take me dancing tonight
I've been all on my own
You promised one day we would
It's what you said on the phone
I'm just a prisoner of love
Always hid from the light
Take me dancing
Please take me dancing tonight

Friday night, 10 o'clock, feeling hot
Me and my senorita's been fighting a lot
So I'm all alone, chilling at home
Without no car, sitting by the telephone
So I called her up (brrring) and apologized (I'm sorry)
I admitted I was insensitive some of the time
"Whaddya say you and me go hit the club
And dance like the first time we fell in love?"

Girrrl, it's like ten to eleven now
Maan, you're probably already laying down
I called to say what's up
And see if you were down to go and steal your momma's car
So we can go dancing, dancing, yeah.

Yeah we did some deep stuff, but we'll handle it tomorrow

As long as we loving, as long as we hugging
As long as we doing our thang that's all that I'm saying
