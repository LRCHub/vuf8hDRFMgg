Last time I think we were too young to understand
What it meant when I held your hand and told you "Be a man"
But now I'm much older than I've ever been
Now I'm getting cold, I need to knit myself a print.

So, please take me out dancing this Saturday night.
Please, get me a little drunk, I won't ask why.
'Cause you know how, how I never tried

I'd wait for you every day until we were done
Remember how we'd always talk about breaking into public pools?
I guess we got lost somewhere along the way
Laying on the floor letting soundwaves erode your brain

So, please take me out dancing this Saturday night.
Please, get me a little drunk, I won't ask why.
'Cause you know how, how I never tried

So, please take me out dancing this Saturday night.
Please, get me a little drunk, I won't ask why.
'Cause you know how, how I never tried

Please take me out dancing this Saturday night.
Please, get me a little drunk, I won't ask why.
'Cause you know how, how I never tried
