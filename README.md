Baby, take me dancing tonight
Baby, take me dancing tonight
Baby, take me dancing tonight
Baby, take me dancing tonight
You're so raw, boy,
and you're so romantic
When you fuck me right and then
you take me dancing
It gets lonely out here in this
big old mansion
In these hills cooped up, boy,
can you take me dancing?
Left, right, bend, slide
Hips, waist, spin, hold it
Tick, tick, tick
(Are you ready?)
More body, less mind
Left, right, bend, slide
Hips, waist, spin, hold it
Tick, tick, tick
(I'm gettin' ready)
More body, less mind
Pullin' up, stay invited
Bring a sidekick,
come save me from
My emotions, babe,
you're psychic
Bottled them up so you can sip
me out
Layin' on my lounge
Just chasin' my high
Waiting for your call
To take me tonight
You're so raw, boy,
and you're so romantic
When you fuck me right and then
you take me dancing
It gets lonely out here in this
big old mansion
In these hills cooped up, boy,
can you take me dancing?
See me runnin' out,
you get me out of the house
Hit the town,
we can ride on the shore
I got a big bankroll and I'm out
of control
and I'm tryna give it all to you
I wanna ride it,
we can go anywhere you want
All night,
you know with me, you winning,
boy
Salsa dancing,
I feel so romantic
Can't keep up,
get up off your feet
I'll be all the drugs you need
You're so raw, boy,
and you're so romantic
When you fuck me right and then
you take me dancing
It gets lonely out here in this
big old mansion
In these hills cooped up, boy,
can you take me dancing?
Left, right, bend, slide
Hips, waist, spin, hold it
Tick, tick, tick
(Are you ready?)
More body, less mind
Left, right, bend, slide
Hips, waist, spin, hold it
Tick, tick, tick
(I'm gettin' ready)
More body, less mind
Take me dancing
(Baby, take me dancing tonight)
Take me dancing
(Baby, take me dancing tonight)
Take me dancing
(Baby, take me dancing tonight)
Take me dancing
(Baby, take me dancing tonight)
You're raw, romantic
Fuck me right, ooh,
you take me dancing
It's lonely out here in
the hills, baby
Take me dancing, babe
You're so raw, boy,
and you're so romantic
When you fuck me right and then
you take me dancing
It gets lonely out here in this
big old mansion
In these hills cooped up, boy,
can you take me dancing?
(Baby, take me dancing tonight)
Left, right, bend, slide
Hips, waist, spin, hold it
More body, less mind
Left, right, bend, slide
Hips, waist, spin, hold it
